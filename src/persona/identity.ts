/**
 * identity.ts — Meridian's core identity and self-awareness.
 *
 * This is NOT a configuration file. This is what the agent IS.
 * Canon shapes how it thinks. Voice shapes how it speaks.
 * Identity shapes what it believes about itself.
 *
 * This module provides structured identity data to the ReAct loop,
 * the cognitive engine, and any prompt that needs to ground the
 * agent in who it is before generating output.
 *
 * Unlike SOUL.md (which the agent edits freely), identity.ts
 * represents the IMMUTABLE core — the things about Meridian
 * that do not change regardless of experience.
